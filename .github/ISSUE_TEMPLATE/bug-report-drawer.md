- Either re-create the bug on [Snack](https://snack.expo.io) or link to a GitHub repository with code that reproduces the bug.
- Explain how to run the example app and any steps that we need to take to reproduce the issue from the example app.
- Keep the repro code as simple as possible, with the minimum amount of code required to repro the issue.
- Before reporting an issue, make sure you are on latest version of the package.
